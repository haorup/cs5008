Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through your_khoury_name@login.khoury.northeastern.edu to complete and test your work. The reason is that this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.

Important notes

    Your code must compile and run on the Khoury machines to earn credit. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
    You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
        Points will be lost if you forget!
    Once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline! Just updating your repository does not work: you must resubmit your repository with any changes to Gradescope. We only grade what you have submitted to Gradescope.
